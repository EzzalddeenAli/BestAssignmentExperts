<p>Trigonometry deals with angles and straight lines as it a very important part of mathematics. Every students need to know the way to deal with this and how to face it. By this assignment, they will have a clear idea on it. <strong>Bestassignmentexperts.com</strong> produces these types of assignment in a very professional manner.</p>
<p>Trigonometry also deals with the <strong>properties of triangle</strong> and calculates values of angle between two lines, which is generally lies between 0 to 90 degrees. At higher range the optimum scale for every triangle, need to be with 360 to 108 degree.</p>

<h3 class="h3-font-size"> Trigonometric functions and relation with each other</h3>
<ul><b>Important function for Trigonometry</b>
<p>Sin x = opposite/ hypotenuse, Tan x = opposite/adjacent, Sec x = hypotenuse/adjacent, Cos x = adjacent/hypotenuse, Cosec x = hypotenuse/ opposite, Cot x = adjacent/opposite</p>
<li><b>Cot x = 1/tan x</b></li>
<li><b>Cosec x = 1/ Sin x</b></li>
<li><b>Sec x = 1/ Cos x</b></li>
<li><b>Tan x = Sin x/ Cos x</b></li>
<li><b>Cot x = Cos x/ Sin x</b></li>
<li><b>Tan x = sec x /cosec x</b></li>
<li><b>Cot x = cosec x / sec x</b></li></ul>

<ul><b>Theorem of Ptolemy</b>
<p>This Theorem is very near to Pythagoras <strong>theorem </strong>as it deals with triangles. By this theorem, if A is an angle of any triangle then Sin2 (A) + Cos2 (A) = 1.</p></ul>
