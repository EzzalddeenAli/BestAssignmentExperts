          <h3 class="h3-font-size">Configuration of the criminal justice structure
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Criminal justice system
              </strong>  is consists of five components and this is common in every country. Our experts will help students in these points: 
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Enforcement of law
              </b>
            </li>
            <p>Responsible officers collect evidence from the 
              <strong>crime scene,
              </strong> prepare a notice about the crime, and provide to the court. They arrest the convict, deliver them for trial in court, and go through with investigations. 
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Lawyers from the government side
              </b>
            </li>
            <p>Lawyers from 
              <strong>government federal 
              </strong> do to the trial room and interrogate the convict. They are against the convicts and willing to punish him for his sins. They present the collected evidence to concrete his position. 
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Defense Lawyer
              </b>
            </li>
            <p>Defense lawyers fight from the 
              <strong>convict’s side
              </strong> and try to present convict as not guilty.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Courts
              </b>
            </li>
            <p>The honorable judges decide the fate of the 
              <strong>convict for his sins
              </strong>  and sent him to the jail or accuse him with the death sentence. Courts are very strict on these types of cases and process the work as the evidence goes.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Corrections
              </b>
            </li>
            <p>Responsible guard is taken the 
              <strong>responsibility
              </strong> to guide the convict towards the jail. They may send him to a personal cell and the officer in duty will observe every situation.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <h4>Essential rights for being guilty
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <p>If a convict proved as guilty, he may go through some of these ways to attempt a last chance to save him: 
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Take the way towards silence
              </b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>He has to face the witnesses
              </b>
            </li>
            <li>
