         <p><strong>Mechanical engineering</strong> is the most important branch of engineering as it contains mechanics and math related to each other. This is the main point off attraction, as this becomes the core part of industries worldwide. Assignment on this is not a matter of joke, as this is very crucial subject and <strong>no scope of error</strong>  can be entertained. This starts its journey from ancient of china and spread worldwide as industrial revolution make a strong impact on this to become the core part of engineering.</p>

<p>Mechanics is the main part of <strong>mechanical engineering</strong> as this play a crucial role into it. All instruments need to be in good way and good mechanics is related to those fast speed dynamics. Along with it, also have topics like <strong>Classical Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics, Statics, Dynamics, Fluid Mechanics, Kinematics, and Mechanics of materials, </strong>.</p>
<h3 class="h3-font-size"> Importance of Mechanical engineering</h3>
<p>Students can earn the <strong>many benefits </strong>if they work as a mechanical engineer because they will face a new world of innovative branch. With the help of this broad branch of mechanics, they will surely gain experiences as earn a lot of salary from this job. This is the core part of mechanical engineering, as this becomes the most important to develop mechanics-related products in industries. Students need to know the main <strong> theory of Mechanical engineering</strong> to work properly as they are going to be the best part of any industrial company.</p> 
<p><strong>Mechanical Electronics</strong> is a combination of mechanics and engineering and nowadays, many things can be made by this. <strong>CD-ROM</strong> is the perfect example of this. However, <strong>Structural Analysis</strong> belongs to that analysis, which is based on the study for mechanics and the study related to every theory and practical. <strong>Thermodynamics</strong> whereas came to be linked with the difficult energy states of a machine.</p>
