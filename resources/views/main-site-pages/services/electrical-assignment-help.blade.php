		 <h2 class="h2-font-size"> Derived way of Electrical assignments</h2>
<ul><p>An electrical assignment consists on many things, which is related to production of electric currents, which are as follows: </p>
<li><b>Generation</b></li>
<p><strong>Generation on electronic current or power</strong>  is the main thing in this assignment, as little equipment is used to generate large amount of electric current. When a flow of flowing water hits a turbine then the generator stores the power of the electric and stores it</p>. 
<li><b>Transmission</b></li>
<p>In this process, <strong> transmitters</strong>  are used to transfer those electrics in a proper way for using and send it to local distribution center of electrical energy. Many huge transmitters can convert up to some thousands volts of currents.</p> 
<li><b>Distribution</b></li>
<p><strong>Distribution of electrical energy</strong>  is very important and it plays an important role to maintain the flow of the current. These assignments help them to have an idea on this.</p>
<li><b>Utilization</b></li>
<p><strong>Utilization of current </strong> comes into play after that as we have electronic equipment use for it .We has to restrict the use of currents because the amount of current is very less in this world.</p></ul>
