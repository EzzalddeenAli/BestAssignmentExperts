          </h2>
          <p>Biochemistry is the 
            <strong>  study of chemical processes
            </strong>  taking place in the human body or in all other
            <strong>   living organisms
            </strong>. It needs 
            <strong>in-depth knowledge 
            </strong> of the biological processes along with chemistry. The study involves 
            <strong>intercellular functions of biological processes
            </strong>. However, it also includes huge experiments along with research-based study.
